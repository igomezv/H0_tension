# H0_tension
-- A fancy way to represent the tension between Hubble constant measurements --

### This is amazing, can I use it?
Sure. You can always reach us (see below) if you'd like an updated/modified version. We're not charging citations (yet), a simple acknowledgment will suffice.

### Are you planning to update this plot when new measurements come out?
We sure do. Let us know if we missed a new result 

### Are you going to make that repository full of these complicated files and tests and docs and all to get a DOI on JOSS ?
Perhaps.
