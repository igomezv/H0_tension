# H0_tension
-- A fancy way to represent the tension between Hubble constant measurements --

### This is amazing, can I use it?
Sure. You can always reach me if you'd like an updated/modified version. I'm not charging citations (yet), a simple acknowledgment will suffice.

### Are you planning to update this plot when new measurements come out?
I sure do. Let me know if I missed a new result 

### Are you going to make that repository full of these complicated files and tests and docs and all to get a DOI on JOSS ?
Perhaps.
